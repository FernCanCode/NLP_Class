Text: Climate change includes both global warming driven by human-induced emissions of greenhouse gases and the resulting large-scale shifts in weather patterns. Though there have been previous periods of climatic change, since the mid-20th century humans have had an unprecedented impact on Earth's climate system and caused change on a global scale.
Step-by-step thinking:
","Main points:
- Climate change involves global warming caused by human-emitted greenhouse gases and large-scale shifts in weather patterns.
- Although climate has changed before, since the mid-20th century humans have had an unprecedented global impact on the Earth's climate system.

Synthesis:
Human-caused greenhouse gas emissions drive global warming and widespread changes in weather patterns. While natural variation exists, the magnitude and pace of change since the mid-20th century are unprecedented due to human activity, affecting the entire climate system.",1037,5.12212610244751
